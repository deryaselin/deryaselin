👋 Hi there! I'm Selin, a software enthusiast passionate about the world of coding. 
Even though I may not have professional experience yet, my passion and desire to 
learn more than make up for it.

🚀 The road I took to become a programmer has been a journey of self-discovery, 
and I've been working hard to enhance my Python, Java, and SQL skills. I dedicated
my free time to develop various side projects such as making a website, 
developing a database management system for a retail store,  analyzing and designing
a new system for a company, and so forth. Along with delivering valuable knowledge, 
they also have strengthened my desire to learn more about this area.

📚 I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to cooperate with others and improve myself in the field. 

🚀 I'm eager to work with experienced developers and undertake new challenges.

🤝If you have a project in mind or offer mentorship, I'd love to hear from you. It's always better when we code together!
